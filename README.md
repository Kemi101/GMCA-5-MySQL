I was asked to write a SQL query to return all the products in our database in the result set.  To show columns; name, unit price, and new column called new price which is based on this expression, (unit price * 1.1 ).
What I will doing is increasing the product price of each by 10%. With the query, I will show the original price and the new price.  This is shown below
